wmdl ( Window Maker DOOM load (meter) )

Version 1.3.7

A simple LOAD or CPU meter using ID Software's DOOM faces.
( More Bloody = more system load or CPU usage ).

Also can monitor almost anything else.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

** NON LINUX -- NOTE **

   The switches '-m cpu' and '-m load' (default) only work with 
   Linux's /proc filesystem.

   For other unixen, use the '-m command' switch. 
   See 'Command Mode Example 1'.

   This '-m command' switch can be used to monitor almost anything.


INSTALL:
--------

    untar and unzip
    make
    copy wmdl to some directory in your $PATH.
    ( ie: cp wmdl /usr/local/bin ) 

    type wmdl

    Grab the appicon and move it to the dock. 

    If make doesn't work, you may need to fiddle with the settings in 
    the Makefile. Please let me know what you did to get it working on your
    flavor of unix.

    Tested on:
        WindowMaker-0.20.3
        X Clients: Red Hat 5.0 intel 
                   Red Hat 5.2 sparc
                   HP-UX 10.20
        X Servers: XFree86, Exceed



USAGE:
------
wmdl 1.3.7
usage: [-v] [-h] 
       [-s yes/no] [-w withdrawn/iconic/normal] 
       [-m cpu/load/uptime] 
       [-f scale_factor ] [-u miliseconds] 
       [-d dislay ] [-g geometry ]


-g                        geometry:  ie: 64x64+10+10
-d                             dpy:  Display. ie: 127.0.0.1:0.0
-v                                :  Verbose.
-h                                :  Help. This screen.
-w         withdrawn/iconic/normal:  Windows: Iconic, Normal, or Withdrawn
-s                          yes/no:  Shaped window: y or n
-m cpu/load/command[command index]:  Use load, cpu, or external command
-f                    scale_factor:  Scale: floating point number = 100% bloody
-u                     miliseconds:  Update period in miliseconds

Defaults:
   -g 64x64+10+10
   -d NULL
   -w withdrawn
   -s yes
   -m load
   -f 1.0   ( for CPU  )
   -f 2.0   ( for LOAD or COMMAND )
   -u 999



Examples:
---------

    wmdl                    Use All defaults ( Just fine for Window Maker)
    wmdl -u 1000            Update every second (1000 miliseconds)
    wmdl -m cpu                Monitor CPU using /proc filesystem.
    wmdl -f .5 -u 750        Scale. A load of .5 is 100% bloody.
                            Update every 3/4 second.
    wmdl -w normal -s no    Normal window mode window not shaped.
                            Do not use shaped windows extension.
    wmdl -v                    Print lots of useless information to stdout.
    wmdl -h                 Usage, Version, and Help.

    Using the command mode: (-m command your_command index )
    -----------------------
     * wmdl executes 'your_command'
     * wmdl uses the index'th token returned by 'your_command'.
     * wmdl processes only the first line returned by command.
     * tokens are seperated by tabs, spaces, newlines, or commas 
     * if you use the -v switch for verbose mode, you can see exactly what
       wmdl is trying to do with your command and index.
     * note: these examples work on my linux box, you may need to twiddle
       with them on your unix flavor.

    Command Mode Example 1:
    -----------------------
    Use the 8th token returned by the shell command 'uptime':
    wmdl -m command uptime 8

    because:
    uptime:    11:47pm  up  3:30,  4 users,  load average: 0.34, 0.33, 0.28
               ^        ^   ^      ^ ^       ^    ^        ^     ^     ^
    index:     1        2   3      4 5       6    7        8     9     10


    Other Unixen:
        HP-UX 10.20:  use '-m command uptime 10'


    Command Mode Example 2:
    -----------------------
    Monitor the number of users with 10 users being 100% bloody:
    wmdl -m command "who | wc -l" 1    -f 10



    Command Mode Example 3:
    -----------------------
    Monitor the ping time to www.slashdot.org with 1000 ms being 100% bloody:
    wmdl -m command "ping www.slashdot.org -c 1 | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 \
      | sed 's/.*time=//'" 1 -f 1000 -v

    Added limited support for 8-bit color depths.
    Sets pixmap closeness attribute to 50001 to match colors already
    allocated if color allocation fails with XpmCratePixmapFromData.
    Also, added some Makefile libs for compiliation on Solaris.
    --thanks to Chris Conn <cconn@abacom.com> for this.

wmdl-1.3.6 Jul 18, 1999
    Fixed bug where atof(strtok(buffer,tokens)) could be trying to do a
    atof(NULL) if the odd occation occoured where reading 
    from /proc/loadavg returned goofy stuff.

wmdl-1.3.5 Feb 13, 1999
    Added the '-m command index' option.
    Overhauled the command line arguments section.
        
wmdl-1.3 Jan 18, 1999
    Fixed default scale being forced when using -m switch.
    Made verbose more usefull.
    Added -w switch. Removed -i switch. Modified -s switch.

wmdl-1.2 Jan 18, 1999
    Fixed scale not handling floating point numbers properly.
    int scale_factor should be float scale_factor in refresh().

wmdl-1.1 Dec 25, 1998
    First version.
